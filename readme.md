# React Mini Projects

A collection of practice projects built while learning React fundamentals.

## Purpose

These projects are created as part of my journey to master React and secure a Junior Frontend Developer position. Each project focuses on specific React concepts and patterns commonly used in real-world applications.

## Projects

### 1. Counter App

A simple counter application with history tracking.

**Concepts practiced:**

- useState with numbers and arrays
- Event handlers
- Array manipulation (spread operator, slice)
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering with map()

**Features:**

- Increment/Decrement buttons
- Reset functionality
- History of last 5 actions
- Prevents negative values

---

### 2. Todo List

A full-featured todo list application with advanced functionality.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Multiple useState hooks
- useEffect for side effects
- localStorage for data persistence
- Controlled inputs
- Conditional rendering with ternary operators
- Array methods (filter, map, sort)
- Inline styles and dynamic styling

**Features:**

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed with checkbox
- Three filter modes: All, Active, Completed
- Priority levels: Low, Medium, High
- Color-coded priority indicators
- Sort by priority
- Enter key to add tasks
- Clear all tasks
- Task counter
- Data persists after page reload

**Technical highlights:**

- Lazy initial state for localStorage
- Separate state management for edit mode
- Helper functions for filtering and sorting
- Dynamic color assignment based on priority

### 3. Calculator

A fully functional calculator with standard and percentage operations.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Multiple useState for state management
- Event handling with parameters
- String manipulation (replace, slice, includes)
- Type conversion (Number, String)
- Conditional logic with if/else
- Error handling (division by zero)

**Features:**

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /)
- Decimal number support with comma separator
- Percentage calculations (both standalone and in context)
- Backspace to delete last character
- All Clear (AC) button
- Display shows full operation (e.g., "52 + 23")
- European number format (comma as decimal separator)
- Error message for division by zero

**Technical highlights:**

- Smart number concatenation vs. replacement logic
- Complex percentage logic: 50% → 0,5 and 200 + 10% → 220
- String parsing to extract operands from display
- Automatic conversion between dots and commas for calculations

---

## Learning Goals

- Master React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Understand component state management
- Practice with forms and controlled components
- Work with localStorage API
- Implement filtering and sorting logic
- Build user-friendly interfaces
- Handle complex conditional logic
- Work with string manipulation and type conversion

## Technologies

- React 18
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vite
- CSS3

## Future Plans

- Add more mini projects (Weather App, etc.)
- Refactor into smaller components
- Add TypeScript
- Implement custom hooks
- Add unit tests
- Improve styling and responsiveness
- Add keyboard support for calculator

## Status

Active learning project. Regular updates as I continue my React education.

## Timeline

Started: November 2024
Current focus: Building practical React applications and mastering core concepts

## About

These projects are part of my self-taught journey to become a Frontend Developer. I dedicate 2 hours daily to hands-on coding practice, focusing on understanding concepts deeply rather than just copying solutions.
