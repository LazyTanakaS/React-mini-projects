# React Mini Projects

A collection of practice projects built while learning React fundamentals.

## Purpose

These projects are created as part of my journey to master React and secure a Junior Frontend Developer position. Each project focuses on specific React concepts and patterns commonly used in real-world applications.

## Projects

### 1. Counter App

A simple counter application with history tracking.

**Concepts practiced:**

- useState with numbers and arrays
- Event handlers
- Array manipulation (spread operator, slice)
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering with map()

**Features:**

- Increment/Decrement buttons
- Reset functionality
- History of last 5 actions
- Prevents negative values

---

### 2. Todo List

A full-featured todo list application with advanced functionality.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Multiple useState hooks
- useEffect for side effects
- localStorage for data persistence
- Controlled inputs
- Conditional rendering with ternary operators
- Array methods (filter, map, sort)
- Inline styles and dynamic styling

**Features:**

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed with checkbox
- Three filter modes: All, Active, Completed
- Priority levels: Low, Medium, High
- Color-coded priority indicators
- Sort by priority
- Enter key to add tasks
- Clear all tasks
- Task counter
- Data persists after page reload

**Technical highlights:**

- Lazy initial state for localStorage
- Separate state management for edit mode
- Helper functions for filtering and sorting
- Dynamic color assignment based on priority

- Add TypeScript
- Implement custom hooks
- Add unit tests
- Improve styling and responsiveness

## About

These projects are part of my self-taught journey to become a Frontend Developer. I dedicate 2 hours daily to hands-on coding practice, focusing on understanding concepts deeply rather than just copying solutions.
